<div>
	There are two set of arrays, one is a set ascending odd numbers and the other
	is a set of descending even numbers. Complete the functionality of the
	component by:
	<ol>
		<li>
			Whenever "Add on Ascending" is triggered, the largest number from the
			descending list will be remove, and will be added to the ascending list,
			then the ascending list will be sorted in ascending order.
		</li>
		<li>
			Whenever "Add on Descending" is triggered, the lowest number from the
			ascending list will be remove, and will be added to the descending list,
			then the descending list will be sorted in descending order.
		</li>
		<li>
			Whenever any list is empty, display "No item on the list" for that
			particular list, then disable the button that corresponds to that list,
			while the other button will be changed to "Refresh". The refresh button
			will reset the status of both list and buttons
		</li>
	</ol>
